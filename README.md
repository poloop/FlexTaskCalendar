FlexTaskCalendar
================

Flex project to test my flex custom TaskCalendar components.

This project use Flex sdk 4.9.1 but should work properly with a more recent sdk.


##Instructions

When you launch the application, you can drag task from the list on the left side to the calendar.
You can drag the task to change its dates.
You can expand the duration by dragging the extremities.
You can zoom in the calendar and move the period with the slider at the bottom.
When you select a task you can delete it with the button delete.
You can print your calendar with the print function. (possibly issues with that functionality)
